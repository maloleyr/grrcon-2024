# grrcon-2024 notes

These are my personal notes from attending GrrCon 2024 in Grand Rapids, MI. 

The simplest way to read these notes will be to clone this repository down to your machine. 

Otherwise enjoy the notes. Again, these are my personal notes and they contain my observations as well.

The "pics" folder will contain various photos I took of slides during presentations. I'll try and document them somewhat.

I've included a copy of the overall schedule as well for a reference point. 

I attended the following talks: 
  - Thursday morning keynote [no notes]
  - The contextual approach to IoT cybersecurity
  - Monsters Under Your Bed - Mapping the Dark Web with Python
  - Demystifying NTLMv1 & MSCHAPv2
  - The Data Risks of Jumping on the RAG Wagon
  - Saving Lives Around the Table: Firefighters' Insights on Tabletops
  - Who Stole the Cookies? Evolution of Access Vectors [no notes]
  - The New SaaS Cyber Kill Chain [no notes]
  - Automobiles, alcohol, blood, sweat, and creative reversing of an obfuscated Car-Modding tool [no notes]
  - Where's the Money: Defeating ATM Disk Encryption
  - The Curious Case of Alice and Bob [no notes]

Some of my overall observations: 
  - A lot of the actual presentations did not really match the description unfortunately.
  - Vendor speakers once again were too vague on what the problem was and how they were going to solve it.
  - Meeting Paul Asadoorian was a pleasure! 
  - Bluemira and Eclypsium seem like cool products to check out.
  - The craft beer on Thursday was exceptionally tasty.
  - Seeing friends!!! I think that is the best part of going to any convention/conference. Meeting up with peers and just checking in. 
  - The room audio and microphones were terrible this year. Presenters either had no clue how to use mics or the staff did not.

Am I looking forward to next year? Duh. Tickets go on sale in the spring so get ready!
