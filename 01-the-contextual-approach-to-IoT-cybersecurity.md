# The Contextual Approach to IoT Cybersecurity

## Speakers

Jason Masker and Yaniv Maimon

## Notes and Observations

- The speakers hail from "Upstream" [https://upstream.auto/]
- From the talk we are seeing IoT in drones, EVs, and charging stations.
- The devices utilize IoT protocols.
- They use multilayer Command and Control (C2).
- There is a cyberphysical aspect: Interference/interruptions can lead to unexpected results and requires a response, often physical. 
- The landscape has large scales of operations, data volume, and complexity.
- New regulations and lax standards. 
- Hardly covered by existing cybersecurity frameworks. 
- There are numerous attack vectors in connected mobility.
- APIs lead to faster threats.
- Example in 2022: Yandex breached, cabs in Moscow were called by the attacker, and caused a physical traffic jam.
  - This was some sort of SiriusXM bug?

  - I think they were conflating two different things?
- 430% increase in threats since 2017. Well duh - more devices! More services! 
- Just knowing the cars VIN you can do some attacks? 
- OK this presentation was definitely _not_ what I expected.
  - There is no context.
  - There is no practical "Here is the problem and how we should solve it." 
  - There really wasn't even a pitch about _how_ their product would help. 
  - But supposedly they have technology to help?
