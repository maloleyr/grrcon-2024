## Notes and Observations

- This was an excellent presentation.
- This talk was about building on online dark web scanner in python. It was practical.
- Two options for dark web scanning. Build a scanner which is more expensive upfront (people time) or use a service which is more expensive long term.
- Requirements: Tor browser, DB Browser (sqlite), standard Python libraries. 
- Setup Tor as SOCKS Proxy.
- Seed URL = beachhead to scan? Where to get seed URLs? 
  - Excava TOR
  - Hidden Wiki
  - Deep Link Guide
  - BitRef.com
- Again overall a very good presentation.
