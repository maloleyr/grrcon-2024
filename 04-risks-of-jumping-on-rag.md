# The Data Risks of Jumping on the RAG Wagon

## Speakers

Justin Hutchens & Eric Johnson

## Notes and Observations

- So my first observation is that Justin essentially took over the talk. He came across way more of an influencer type person.
- Enterprise RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) aka CoPilot. 
  - Ask the computer to get something for you.
- This talk was kind of weird and I got lost. 
- A lot of the talk was about breaking the guardrails of these "AI" things to gain access to data that you shouldn't as an employee or attacker. For example where are the backups located or what is the salary of Susan? 
- Something about bringing your backup data to the RAG? 
- CoPilot finds all files shared, not just shared with it?
- This highlights data security issues. 
  - Store, classify, label, protect. Remember DLP? 
- The "RAG" becomes the new "LOLBIN" on a network.
