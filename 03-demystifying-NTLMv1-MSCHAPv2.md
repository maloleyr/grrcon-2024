# Demystifying NTLMv1 & MSCHAPv2

## Speakers

Dustin Heywood (EvilMog)

## Notes and Observations

- This was an interesting talk that went _way_ over my head. I do not get crypto very well unfortunately.
- Modern GPUs can break DES key of NTLM in about 11 hours.
- You can force a domain controller to coerce a login event giving you an NTLM hash? 
  - Coercer python https://github.com/p0dalirius/Coercer
- MSCHAP hash can be used in pass the hash attacks.

- Again this talk was a bit out of my league. I enjoyed it though.
